## Overview

This project involves the analysis of public transportation data to improve service efficiency and passenger experience. The dataset contains information about trips, routes, stops, and passenger boardings.

## Dataset Source

The dataset was obtained from [Dataset Source Name/Link]. It includes the following columns:

- TripID
- RouteID
- StopID
- StopName
- WeekBeginning
- NumberOfBoardings

## Dependencies

To run the code and replicate the analysis, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- TextBlob (for sentiment analysis)

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib textblob
Replicating the Analysis
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone [https://github.com/varaprasad144/NM_PUBLICTRANPORTANALYIS_PHASE5#nm_publictranportanalyis_phase5]
Step 2: Download the Dataset
Download the dataset from [(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rednivrug/unisys?select=20140711.CSV)] and place it in the data/ directory.

python public_transport_analysis.py
This will execute the code and perform the analysis on the dataset.

Generating Visualizations using IBM Cognos
To generate visualizations using IBM Cognos, follow these steps:

# Provide instructions on how to replicate the analysis and generate visualizations using IBM Cognos and perform data analysis using code

This section provides detailed instructions on how to replicate the analysis and generate visualizations using IBM Cognos, as well as perform data analysis using code.

## Replicating the Analysis using IBM Cognos

1. **Login to IBM Cognos:**
   - Navigate to the IBM Cognos platform and log in with your credentials.

2. **Access the Project Folder:**
   - Locate and access the project folder titled "Marginal Workers Analysis".

3. **Import the Dataset:**
   - In IBM Cognos, import the dataset `marginal_workers_data.csv` from the project folder.

4. **Create Visualizations:**
   - Use the imported dataset to create visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables based on your analysis requirements.

5. **Save and Export Visualizations:**
   - Save the created visualizations in a suitable format for future reference or inclusion in reports.

## Performing Data Analysis using Code

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Launch a Jupyter Notebook from the project directory by running the command `jupyter notebook Marginal_Workers_Analysis.ipynb`.

2. **Review Code Sections:**
   - Inside the Jupyter Notebook, review the code sections for data processing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.

3. **Execute Code Cells:**
   - Execute each code cell sequentially to perform the analysis steps described in the respective code comments.

4. **Review Results:**
   - Review the output, findings, and visualizations generated by the code.

5. **Customize and Extend Analysis:**
   - Modify the code or add additional analysis steps as per specific requirements or research goals.
